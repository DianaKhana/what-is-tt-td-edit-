# what-is-tt-td-edit-
Hello. Today my old post with the familiar title is this, so i explain what tt / td is! TT means touch trigger, td is touch discomfort. When u see a pony with tt/td in name, DONT TOUCH THEM! Also. they can let ppl touch them if they in their friend list. You see, this post is made in 2022, and old one in 2021.
